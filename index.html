    <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa (Italian: Torre pendente di Pisa) or simply the<br> Tower of Pisa (Torre di Pisa ['torre di 'pi?za]) is the campanile,<br> or freestanding bell tower, of the cathedral of the Italian city of Pisa,<br> known worldwide for its unintended tilt. The tower is situated behind the<br> Pisa Cathedral and is the third oldest structure in the city's Cathedral Square <br>(Piazza del Duomo), after the cathedral and the Pisa Baptistry.</p>
<p>
The tower's tilt began during construction in the 12th century, caused by an<br> inadequate foundation on ground too soft on one side to properly support the<br> structure's weight. The tilt increased in the decades before the structure was<br> completed in the 14th century. It gradually increased until the structure was stabilized (and the tilt partially <br>corrected) by efforts in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p> </div>

      <h2  id="architect">Architect</h2>
      <p>There has been controversy about the real identity of the architect of the Leaning Tower of Pisa.<br> For many years, the design was attributed to Guglielmo and Bonanno Pisano, a well-known <br>12th-century resident artist of Pisa, famous for his bronze casting, particularly in the Pisa Duomo.<br> Pisano left Pisa in 1185 for Monreale, Sicily, only to come back and die in his home town.</p><p> A piece of cast bearing his name was discovered at the foot of the tower in 1820,<br> but this may be related to the bronze door in the façade of the cathedral that was destroyed in 1595.<br> A 2001 study seems to indicate Diotisalvi was the original architect, due to the time of construction<br> and affinity with other Diotisalvi works, notably the bell tower of San Nicola and the Baptistery, both in Pisa.</p>

      <h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
      <p>Construction of the tower occurred in three stages over 199 years. Work on the ground floor of the white marble campanile began on August 14, 1173 during a period of military success and prosperity. This ground floor is a blind arcade articulated by engaged columns with classical Corinthian capitals.</p>

<p>The tower began to sink after construction had progressed to the second floor in 1178. This was due to a mere three-metre foundation, set in weak, unstable subsoil, a design that was flawed from the beginning. Construction was subsequently halted for almost a century, because the Republic of Pisa was almost continually engaged in battles with Genoa, Lucca, and Florence. This allowed time for the underlying soil to settle. Otherwise, the tower would almost certainly have toppled. In 1198, clocks were temporarily installed on the third floor of the unfinished construction.</p>

<p>In 1272, construction resumed under Giovanni di Simone, architect of the Camposanto. In an effort to compensate for the tilt, the engineers built upper floors with one side taller than the other. Because of this, the tower is curved. Construction was halted again in 1284 when the Pisans were defeated by the Genoans in the Battle of Meloria.</p>
<p>
The seventh floor was completed in 1319. The bell-chamber was finally added in 1372. It was built by Tommaso di Andrea Pisano, who succeeded in harmonizing the Gothic elements of the bell-chamber with the Romanesque style of the tower.There are seven bells, one for each note of the musical major scale. The largest one was installed in 1655.[citation needed]
      </p>
<p>After a phase (1990–2001) of structural strengthening, the tower is currently undergoing gradual surface restoration, in order to repair visible damage, mostly corrosion and blackening. These are particularly pronounced due to the tower's age and its exposure to wind and rain.</p>

       <h2 id="guinness">Guinness World Records</h2>
      <p>Two German churches have challenged the tower's status as the world's most lop-sided building: the 15th-century square Leaning Tower of Suurhusen and the 14th-century bell tower in the town of Bad Frankenhausen.[26] Guinness World Records measured the Pisa and Suurhusen towers, finding the former's tilt to be 3.97 degrees. In June 2010, Guinness World Records certified the Capital Gate building in Abu Dhabi, UAE as the "World's Furthest Leaning Man-made Tower". The Capital Gate tower has an 18-degree slope, almost five times more than the Pisa Tower; however the Capital Gate tower has been deliberately engineered to slant. The Leaning Tower of Wanaka in New Zealand, also deliberately built, leans at 53 degrees to the ground.</p>
